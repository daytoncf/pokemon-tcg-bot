# pokemon-tcg-bot
This is a bot that uses the Pokemon TCG API to provide quick display of any printed pokemon card in a discord server!

This is still a work in progress. Further documentation will be uploaded upon completion of commands.

# Motivation
My friends and I became somewhat avid pokemon card collectors and I wanted to build an easier way of sharing our cards directly into chat instead of having to pull out our phones and take a picture or search the web for them

# Commands
More commands are to be added such as `/get-value`, `/get-stats`, and even querying capabilities with `/search-card`!

Currently the only functional command is `/get-card` EX: `/get-card card-id:swsh1-1`
